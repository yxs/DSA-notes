[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

> An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

time complexity `O(n(k+|Σ|))`,
`n` is len(strs),
`k` is longest str in strs,
`Σ` is a character set, this problem is 26 lowercase letters,

space complexity `O(n(k+|Σ|))`


```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict


class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        # counter str in strs, use count as hash key
        ans = defaultdict(list)

        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord[c] - ord("a")] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()

```
