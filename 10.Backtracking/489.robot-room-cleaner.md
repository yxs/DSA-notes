Q: m x n binary grid where `0` represents a wall and `1` represents an empty slot. The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn is 90 degrees. Use robots clean the entire room, design APIs.


A: Clean from the starting position and mark. Carry out dfs in 4 directions, if there are obstacles or searched, turn right.

1. do: move
2. backtrack()
3. undo: go back


Time complexity: 

Space complexity: O(N - M)
